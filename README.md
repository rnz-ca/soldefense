# Sol Defense

This is my project for the CM3070-Final Project course.  

It is a vertical shooter inspired on the classic Space Invaders.  I used Visual Studio 2022, C++, SDL and FMOD for the implementation in Windows.  SDL and FMOD are crossplatform libraries which means code could be easily compiled in Xcode/MacOS, Linux or other OSes.

The image-source folder contains spritesheets in Affinity Photo file format.
